Emphasis on starting point because from here, people would be free to branch out and \"explore\". \nEach time someone explores a new \"area\" it would expand this ever-growing web of digital roads. \n\nWith each new road formed, there'd be certain amounts of \"real estate\" available. Each available plot would function as a blank slate for whatever people could come up with. I always imagined people setting up shops or showcases for services they offer, public gathering spots (forums) to share or discuss ideas with.\n\nInitially, there'd be a land grab around starting nodes. These would be the areas with the most traffic and as such would be highly desirable.\nIn order to prevent people from camping, as well as keep things in flux, different areas would have \"rent\" or \"property tax\" based on foot traffic as well as interaction. \n\nThe economy would then be based on interaction as well as \"depth of interactions\"(?). \n\nEventually, different starting nodes would receive highways between. I always imagined these as information superhighways, roads meant to connect vastly different cultures that could then freely exchange ideas and knowledge.","lastmodified":"2023-08-10T18:41:23.401354513Z","tags":["blogging"]},"/Areas/blog/posts/Humble-Beginnings":{"title":"Humble Beginnings","content":"\n08/03/21\n\nIt took me a few days, but I finally got things together. \n\nI was stumped for a little while, trying to figure out why the CSS for my page wasn't rendering.

Often times, I bring this up and lot of people will do their best to defend motivation.\n\n\u003e \"You need motivation to do x.\" \"Motivation is why you do y.\"\n\nAll complete bullshit in my, and many others' eyes. \n\nDiscipline. \n\nI can't really define discipline as I don't have a true understanding of it, or how to help develop it. \n\nBut if I had to try, I would say this:\n\u003e Discipline is the skill of doing what needs to be done, even if we don't want to.\n\nI initially wanted to say \"doing what we've previously decided needs to be done,\" but thinking about it, there are things we've not thought about prior that requires discipline at times. \n\nIt takes discipline to get out of bed when the sheets are just that comfy.

I believe this requires me to learn more about [[Resource/wiki/web design/Hugo|Hugo]]?\n\nCurrently reading: https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/ on [[Resource/wiki/web design/Taxonomies|Taxonomies]]. \n\nAppears that taxonomies would be useful for the wiki, but not for easier access to blog/posts. \n\u003e This turned out to be a dead end. Did not end up needing to go into taxonomies at all, maybe at a future date.\n\nMy temporary measure for accessing the blog is to just have a link on my main page to the blog. \nHugo allows you to create index pages if you title the file `_index`. \n\nThe index shows all pages in the same folder or below it so I don't have to manually add each new blog post to a directory. The only downside to note is that blog posts are in alphabetical order rather than in chronological order. \nA simple solution for this is to add dates to all the file names.\n\nThe next problem that arose was that using [[Resource/wiki/productivity/Obsidian|Obsidian]] I am able to easily link notes together. But linking directly to the index file makes it look ugly and unintuitive. It creates a hyperlink that says `_index`, which is functional. But not ideal.\ninitially, I attempted to use Hugo markdown to create a hyperlink named Blog but for some reason the file path didn't work. I am unsure if it doesn't because of some user error or if there is something else going on underneath the hood. \n\nThe next thing I figured out was that where hugo stores markdown meta info, I can create taggable aliases. \nIn my index page for the blog posts the beginning of my post looks like this: \n`---\ntitle: \"Blog\"\naliases:\n- Blog\n---`\nThis works with Obisidian, so using Obsidians linking feature I am able to create a link to `/Areas/blog/_index` with ease.\n\nThe next problem arises with tables. I am able to create tables, but it looks like internal links (at least the way Obsidian does links, markdown and wikilinks) are broken when inside tables.
