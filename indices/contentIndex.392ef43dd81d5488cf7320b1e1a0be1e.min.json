Never really knew what its purpose would be but I've always wanted to have one. \n\nFinally stumbled upon an idea called a [[Projects/20230806 Build Digital Garden Foundation/Digital Garden]]\nTrying to figure out what exactly the idea/philosophy behind a digital garden is sort of tough, but my understanding of it as an highly interconnected repository of knowledge. \nSome of the graphs I'm seeing really illustrates the links between different ideas. It's wild. \n\nIn order to start, I'm doing more and more research. \n\nI've decided on using [[Projects/20230806 Build Digital Garden Foundation/Obsidian]] as my editor as I think it has the most capability for creating the backlinks needed? It looks clean and I from my understanding it works well with [[Projects/20230806 Build Digital Garden Foundation/Quartz]].\n\nThe primary inspiration for my garden is: https://www.ssp.sh/brain// \nI feel like the structure of the site can act as a good foundation/example for what mine could be.","lastmodified":"2023-08-03T20:50:52.500416127Z","tags":[]},"/Areas/blog/Humble-Beginnings":{"title":"Humble Beginnings","content":"\n08/03/21\n\nIt took me a few days, but I finally got things together. \n\nI was stumped for a little while, trying to figure out why the CSS for my page wasn't rendering. I deleted and re-forked the repo a few times, looked at my configs over and over again. \n\nI didn't realize it would take some time for the page to render. I saw a comment on Discord or some website/resource that suggested this.

Just need to decide how to structure content and what kind of stuff I want to publish. Basically, I need time and to mess around to break and then fix things.","lastmodified":"2023-08-03T20:50:52.500416127Z","tags":[]},"/Projects/20230806-Build-Digital-Garden-Foundation/Digital-Garden":{"title":"Digital Garden","content":"alt.","lastmodified":"2023-08-03T20:50:52.500416127Z","tags":[]},"/Projects/20230806-Build-Digital-Garden-Foundation/Obsidian":{"title":"Obsidian","content":"\nA note taking app that easily allows the ability to create backlinks to different notes.\nhttps://obsidian.md/community","lastmodified":"2023-08-03T20:50:52.500416127Z","tags":[]},"/Projects/20230806-Build-Digital-Garden-Foundation/Quartz":{"title":"Quartz","content":"\nI'm not entirely sure what Quartz does. \nIt might be a static site generator with digital gardens as a focus?\nMeant to be used with [[Projects/20230806 Build Digital Garden Foundation/Obsidian]].\nhttps://quartz.jzhao.xyz","lastmodified":"2023-08-03T20:50:52.500416127Z","tags":[]},"/Projects/20230806-Build-Digital-Garden-Foundation/References":{"title":"References","content":"https://www.ssp.sh/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/---","lastmodified":"2023-08-03T20:50:52.500416127Z","tags":[]},"/Projects/20230806-Build-Digital-Garden-Foundation/Second-Brain":{"title":"Second Brain","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-03T20:50:52.500416127Z","tags":[]},"/Projects/private/private-note":{"title":"Private Stuff","content":"\nThis page doesn't get published!","lastmodified":"2023-08-03T20:50:52.500416127Z","tags":[]}}
