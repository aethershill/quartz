Each available plot would function as a blank slate for whatever people could come up with. I always imagined people setting up shops or showcases for services they offer, public gathering spots (forums) to share or discuss ideas with.\n\nInitially, there'd be a land grab around starting nodes. These would be the areas with the most traffic and as such would be highly desirable.\nIn order to prevent people from camping, as well as keep things in flux, different areas would have \"rent\" or \"property tax\" based on foot traffic as well as interaction. \n\nThe economy would then be based on interaction as well as \"depth of interactions\"(?). \n\nEventually, different starting nodes would receive highways between. I always imagined these as information superhighways, roads meant to connect vastly different cultures that could then freely exchange ideas and knowledge.","lastmodified":"2023-09-01T16:22:08.164263619Z","tags":["blogging"]},"/Areas/blog/posts/Humble-Beginnings":{"title":"Humble Beginnings","content":"\n08/03/21\n\nIt took me a few days, but I finally got things together. \n\nI was stumped for a little while, trying to figure out why the CSS for my page wasn't rendering.

I believe this requires me to learn more about [[Resource/wiki/web design/Hugo|Hugo]]?\n\nCurrently reading: https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/ on [[Resource/wiki/web design/Taxonomies|Taxonomies]]. \n\nAppears that taxonomies would be useful for the wiki, but not for easier access to blog/posts.^[This turned out to be a dead end. Did not end up needing to go into taxonomies at all, maybe at a future date.]\n\n## Temporary measures\nMy plan for accessing the blog is to just have a link on my main page. \nHugo allows you to create index pages if you title the file `_index`. \n\nThe index shows all pages in the same folder or below it so I don't have to manually add each new blog post to a directory (or MoC). The only downside to note is that blog posts are in alphabetical order rather than in chronological order.^[Realized after that posts are being ordered chronologically by most recently updated, which I think is fine.]\nA simple solution for this is to add dates to all the file names.\n\nThe next problem that arose was that using [[Resource/wiki/productivity/Obsidian|Obsidian]] I am able to easily link notes together. But linking directly to the index file makes it look ugly and unintuitive. It creates a hyperlink that says `_index`, which is functional. But not ideal.\ninitially, I attempted to use Hugo markdown to create a hyperlink named Blog but for some reason the file path didn't work. I am unsure if it doesn't because of some user error or if there is something else going on underneath the hood. \n\n## Aliases\nThe next thing I figured out was that where hugo stores markdown meta info, I can create taggable aliases. \nIn my index page for the blog posts the beginning of my post looks like this: \n\n```\ntitle: \"Blog\"\naliases:\n- Blog\n```\n\nThis works with Obisidian, so using Obsidians linking feature I am able to create a link to `/Areas/blog/_index` with ease.\n\n## Internal links in tables not working?\nThinking that \"surely my issues are almost over\", I was wrong found an issue with tables. I am able to create tables.\nI created a table for my Map of Content, using that look I mentioned earlier in this post for its simplicity.\nLinked to all folder indexes I wanted mapped so far.\nAnd then when the page rendered after being published, it looked like internal links (at least the way Obsidian does links, markdown and wikilinks) are broken when inside tables. \n\nInitially linking to the index files, which works in Obsidian led to the link just being broken. \n`[[Resources/wiki/pkm/_index.md]]`\nFirst though was to try to drop the .md and see if this worked. \n`[[Resource/wiki/pkm/_index]]`\nThis succeeded in rendering as a link, but the internal link was apparently broken and would otherwise lead to nowhere.\n\nAfter looking at the links for categories I could get to using [Quartz](Resource/wiki/web%20design/Quartz.md) built in search, I mistakenly tried: `[[Resource/wiki/pkm/_index/#]]` \nLooking back the reason why this didn't work immediately comes to mind but stumped me for a solid 10-15 minutes. \nIn the end linking to the folder itself was the solution I needed the entire time. \nLinking to the folder will automatically direct you to the index page with a clean URL structure. \nThis extra understanding leads me to think I can drop the Aliases from the blog post and just link to my blog folder, save a few bytes or kb.\n\nAs a little test, I decided to try remove index.md from Web Design to see if linking to the folder would still work. As I should have remembered from when I first started messing around with websites, no.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-01T16:22:08.164263619Z","tags":["blogging"]},"/Areas/inbox/Anime-To-Watch-List":{"title":"Anime To Watch List","content":"# _Hotarubi no Mori e_","lastmodified":"2023-09-01T16:22:08.164263619Z","tags":[]},"/Areas/inbox/Objectivitiy":{"title":"Objectivitiy","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-09-01T16:22:08.164263619Z","tags":[]},"/Areas/inbox/Scope":{"title":"Scope","content":"I just finished a phone interview for my winter job, and the person I spoke to asked a question about what motivates me to come in to work with a positive attitude. \nMy answer was fine (I think) but they also noted appreciation of where we're at.
