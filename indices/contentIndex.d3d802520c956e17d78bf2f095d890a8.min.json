Never really knew what its purpose would be but I've always wanted to have one. \n\nFinally stumbled upon an idea called a [[Areas/blog/Digital Garden]]\nTrying to figure out what exactly the idea/philosophy behind a digital garden is sort of tough, but my understanding of it as an highly interconnected repository of knowledge. \nSome of the graphs I'm seeing really illustrates the links between different ideas. It's wild. \n\nIn order to start, I'm doing more and more research. \n\nI've decided on using [[Resources/wiki/productivity/Obsidian]] as my editor as I think it has the most capability for creating the backlinks needed? It looks clean and I from my understanding it works well with [[Areas/blog/Quartz]].\n\nThe primary inspiration for my garden is: https://www.ssp.sh/brain// \nI feel like the structure of the site can act as a good foundation/example for what mine could be.","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T21:10:03.844742721Z","tags":[]},"/Areas/blog/posts/Digital-Cities":{"title":"Digital Cities","content":"Growing up, I had an idea for a website. \n\nInitially there would be one starting point (node), or maybe a couple based on region/language. Emphasis on starting point because from here, people would be free to branch out and \"explore\". \nEach time someone explores a new \"area\" it would expand this ever-growing web of digital roads. \n\nWith each new road formed, there'd be certain amounts of \"real estate\" available. Each available plot would function as a blank slate for whatever people could come up with. I always imagined people setting up shops or showcases for services they offer, public gathering spots (forums) to share or discuss ideas with.\n\nInitially, there'd be a land grab around starting nodes. These would be the areas with the most traffic and as such would be highly desirable.\nIn order to prevent people from camping, as well as keep things in flux, different areas would have \"rent\" or \"property tax\" based on foot traffic as well as interaction. \n\nThe economy would then be based on interaction as well as \"depth of interactions\"(?). \n\nEventually, different starting nodes would receive highways between. I always imagined these as information superhighways, roads meant to connect vastly different cultures that could then freely exchange ideas and knowledge.","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T21:10:03.844742721Z","tags":[]},"/Areas/blog/posts/Humble-Beginnings":{"title":"Humble Beginnings","content":"\n08/03/21\n\nIt took me a few days, but I finally got things together. \n\nI was stumped for a little while, trying to figure out why the CSS for my page wasn't rendering.

I saw a comment on Discord or some website/resource that suggested this. So leaving things alone overnight allowed everything to work itself out.\n\nFor anyone that decides to create their own [[Areas/blog/Digital Garden|Digital Garden]] using [[Areas/blog/Quartz|Quartz]], definitely keep it mind that it can take a few minutes-hours for the page to fully generate.\n\nFrom this point forward it \"should\" be smooth sailing. Just need to decide how to structure content and what kind of stuff I want to publish. Basically, I need time and to mess around to break and then fix things.\n\nNext for me to figure out is how to structure the site. \n","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T21:10:03.844742721Z","tags":[]},"/Projects/private/private-note":{"title":"Private Stuff","content":"\nThis page doesn't get published!","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T21:10:03.844742721Z","tags":[]}}
