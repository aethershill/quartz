- Constantly Moving (Moving 2-3 times a year).
- No home base for possessions (Unless you pay for 2 spots)
- Seasonal relationships
- Frequent Job Searching

## No Home Base
Not having a home base makes it difficult to accumulate possessions. This can be a good thing, depending on your lifestyle/intentions (if you trend towards Minimalism). But other times, it does become a hassle. 
I have a storage container in Colorado for my snowboard gear. It doesn't make sense to buy new gear every season, and even less sense to fly with my gear due to how much space it takes up and how expensive it would get.
Items I would like to collect, I can't because of the same reasons. 
Signed items I get from concerts. Souvenirs. Etc.
I have to consider whether things will fit in my luggage. 

## Constantly Moving
Closely related is the issue of constantly moving.
I have to pack and unpack a MINIMUM of two times a year. 
End/beginning of summer and end/beginning of Winter.
On top of this, I like to travel between seasons. 
In 2023, I had to pack and unpack 4 times and lost some things during the moves.

## Seasonal relationships
All of your relationships are seasonal. 
I have made a few friends in which we stay in contact between seasons. These are primarily friends in the places I go back to.
But not everyone returns. And you don't hear from everyone. 
A majority of these friendships I have made, I will likely never see/speak to again.

Dating also tends to be seasonal or less so. 
On occasion, people do find long term relationships. Some even get married. 
They are the exception, not the rule.
Every place I've worked so far has a general rule of thumb. 
If a guy is dating a girl, that just means it's his turn. 

In other words, you don't lose the girl, you lose your turn. 

Again, not everyone is like this, and not all relationships turn out this way. But finding a long term relationship is unlikely. Most do short term/casual hookups. It's not uncommon for relationships to be solely for that season. 

## Frequent Job Searching
You are basically constantly job searching. There are some that find a place, and they return year after year, season after season. If you do find that place, if you are like that, then awesome. I'm extremely happy it worked out for you.

I, and others, are constantly looking for the next adventure. 
Some return for more seasons than they'd like, but they are looking for a new, hopefully better experience, and will jump at it as soon as possible. 
I am eyeing Hawaii for my summers as I need a board sport to keep me from drinking away all my earnings. 
Some places end up not being what we hoped they would be when we arrived. 
Others are just genuinely bad experiences. Sometimes we have friends who invite us out to new places and we want to join along. 
When we do have a gig we're returning too, we often still have to jump through some hoops to start. Orientations we've seen before. The same paperwork we've been filing for years, etc.

It does get tiring and at times I wish I could just have one job. Not having to worry about all of these things. But it's the life style i chose.
