reference: [[The Power of Moments]]

Time feels like it's going by faster because of the lack of [[mile markers in time]].  

*ie: If the last thing you can really remember/notice is 3 months ago, then all that time in between then and now feels like it went by with a snap.

But if we fill our life with more novel moments that can act as mile markers then time feels like it slows down.

After thinking about this more, I realize that novel moments are a quick solution to slowing down the feeling of time passing. 

The most important aspect of this is presence. Novel moments (activities) make it easy to be present. But if we strive to be more present in daily life, then we can more consistently slow down the passage of time.
Like when we're staring at the clock waiting for a certain time.
