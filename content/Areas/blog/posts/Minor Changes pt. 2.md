## To Summarize
I've found workarounds or solutions for all the problems in [[Minor Changes (Or Headaches)]]

The notes that were showing the date of when I pushed changes, didn't have created and modified tags as my newer updated pages do.
Now I have to do the tedious task of going through EVERYTHING and figuring out what needs to be updated and what doesn't. - Completed

As to the issue with [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) . I don't need to solve that. Yet, haha. 
I realized that since I've fixed the date issues on all my notes. The recent notes section on the [Index](_index) will do what I need to. 
Now, I will soon need to figure out a solution to rendering data view graphs because in a future update, I plan on using dataview for my [[Booklist]]. My read, to read, dropped, etc. list. 
But for now, I don't need to do that. I'm just glad I figured out this issue that's been plaguing me for a while.
