It took me a few days, but I finally got things together. 

I was stumped for a little while, trying to figure out why the CSS for my page wasn't rendering. I deleted and re-forked the repo a few times, looked at my configs over and over again. 

I didn't realize it would take some time for the page to render. I saw a comment on Discord or some website/resource that suggested this. So leaving things alone overnight allowed everything to work itself out.

For anyone that decides to create their own [[Areas/blog/Digital Garden|Digital Garden]] using [[Areas/blog/Quartz|Quartz]], definitely keep it mind that it can take a few minutes-hours for the page to fully generate.

From this point forward it "should" be smooth sailing. Just need to decide how to structure content and what kind of stuff I want to publish. Basically, I need time and to mess around to break and then fix things.

Next for me to figure out is how to structure the site.
