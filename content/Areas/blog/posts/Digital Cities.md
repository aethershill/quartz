Growing up, I had an idea for a website. 

Initially there would be one starting point (node), or maybe a couple based on region/language. Emphasis on starting point because from here, people would be free to branch out and "explore". 
Each time someone explores a new "area" it would expand this ever-growing web of digital roads. 

With each new road formed, there'd be certain amounts of "real estate" available. Each available plot would function as a blank slate for whatever people could come up with. I always imagined people setting up shops or showcases for services they offer, public gathering spots (forums) to share or discuss ideas with.

Initially, there'd be a land grab around starting nodes. These would be the areas with the most traffic and as such would be highly desirable.
In order to prevent people from camping, as well as keep things in flux, different areas would have "rent" or "property tax" based on foot traffic as well as interaction. 

The economy would then be based on interaction as well as "depth of interactions"(?). 

Eventually, different starting nodes would receive highways between. I always imagined these as information superhighways, roads meant to connect vastly different cultures that could then freely exchange ideas and knowledge.
