My name is Masa! Short for Masanori, although some know me as Ken or Kenley. I have two first names. 

Unlike most of the other digital gardens (more public facing ones that is) I am not an engineer. Nor do I come from any background like that. 
Tech enthusiast/nerd? For sure. 

Raised in Ohio I am currently a nomad. I bounce around the country doing seasonal work. Primarily, I am a Bartender. Although I am looking to settle down and work towards a career change. Hopefully, that means within the next few years there will be a dump of information/notes when I begin my studies.
