	 "If you shape your life according to nature, you will never be poor; if according other people's opinions, you will never be rich." - Epicurus

	Natures wants are small, while those of opinion are limitless

	Natural desires are limited; those. which spring from false opinions have nowhere to stop, for falsity has no point of termination.

	When a person is following a track, there is an eventual end to it somewhere, but with wandering at large there is no limit.

	Whenever you want to know whether the desire aroused in you by something you are pursuing is natural or quite unseeing, ask yourself whether it is capable of coming to rest at any point; if after going a long way there is something remaining farther away, be sure it is not something natural.
