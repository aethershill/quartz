Alaska, is probably my favorite place in the world. For now.
Here is a few reasons, not listed in any particular order, of why you should spend a Summer in Alaska (or otherwise just visit).
# The Scenery
The first reason, is the scenery.
There is so much to explore and see, that you really can't do it in one summer. If you're lucky (or is it unlucky) it could take you an entire lifetime to see all you want to see.
 The Northern lights, the katmai bears, the midnight sun or the near constant darkness, Mt. Denali, all kinds of wildlife (polar bears, moose, etc.).
 There is no shortage of things to see and experience for the first time. 
# The People
I have met some of my favorite people working summers in Alaska. The locals are generally great people, as long as you're respectful. And all kinds of people come to visit, live, work. You'll meet people from everywhere, from all kinds of backgrounds. Freshly turned 18 year olds who aspired to live the wunderlust filled life of Chris McCandless from Into the Wild, 60 something year olds who are checking off Alaska from their lifelong bucket list. 30 year olds trying to find themselves.
You'll find lifelong friends (or sometimes husband and wives) out here.
# How Long the Days Feel
My first Summer in Alaska, time stretched. Every day felt like 3 days. In the 5 months I spent there it felt like I spent almost 2 years right outside Denali NP. I experienced so much, and grew so much from just 1 summer there. It almost felt magical. The amount of stuff you could do. The experiences had. It was like summer day days as a kid where moments playing with friends in backyards stretched into forever.
# Alaska Allows You to be More You
From function over fashion to just outright weirdness. Something about Alaska, pushes people to be themselves. More themself than they ever knew they could be. For better (or for worse). In my case, I left my first summer with a better understanding of who I am. My second summer brought some of my flaws and forced me to confront them. Who knows what my third summer will teach me about myself.

# How Unique an Experience it is
Every summer is a different experience. There is a lot you can come to expect that will be the same. It could just be seasonal work, but I've heard and personally found that there will be a curveball every summer. No matter who you are, you will find yourself challenged in ways you never thought you would.

# Bonus: Some aspects feel 20 years behind
Because of how remote and rough it can be. It isn't always the best idea to have the newest stuff or stuff trying to keep up with trends. 
Cars are notorious for having Alaskan windshields. The used car market is always sorta eh.
