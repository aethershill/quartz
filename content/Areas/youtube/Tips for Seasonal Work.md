# 1 - Start Early
## Apply Early
The sooner you start applying, the better.
Summer jobs start getting filled by the end of February.
Winter jobs (particularly ski resorts) you should start applying by July/August.

## The  Younger You are the Better
Younger ages tend to be tied to less responsibilities and obligations you have.
Some jobs trend towards younger ages. For example, at Steamboat 25 can feel old depending on the job/coworkers.

# 2 - Cash Cushion
$1,000
This is the minimum I would recommend, depending on the area and job.
Some jobs are biweekly, meaning it will be almost a month before your first paycheck. Groceries, Drinking, and Eating out really cuts into costs.

# 3 - Do Your Research
Know what you're getting into ahead of time.
Look into what housing is like, grocery stores nearby, gyms, etc. Stuff to do in free time. What the company is like. Culture in the area. 

# 4 - Mindset
Work harder play harder.
