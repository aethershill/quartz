I just finished a phone interview for my winter job, and the person I spoke to asked a question about what motivates me to come in to work with a positive attitude. 
My answer was fine (I think) but they also noted appreciation of where we're at. Where we get to live and work. 

I've worked two summers in Alaska. 
I have mountains in almost any direction, the most beautiful landscape I've seen is here. In June I get 22 hours of sunlight. Outside of that (when it gets dark enough) I have the northern lights. 
And yet almost every day at work I'm pissed off.

Because something dials me in, something irritates me and I'm stuck on that for however long, minutes, hours, days. I lower my scope to focus on that, but when I take in everything, I see everything for what it is and its beauty, it's so hard to not be happy and love it all. 

I need to fix my mindset, my attitude. Work on my gratitude and rescope when things are getting rough like that.
