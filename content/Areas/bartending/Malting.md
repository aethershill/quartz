The process by which [[grains]] are germinated, converting the starch stores in each grain into sugar.

This process then leads to [Fermentation](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Fermentation.md) to continue the process.

To start, the grain is allowed to grow. As it grows it creates enzymes. 
Eventually, hot air is used to stop the growth of the grains. 
At this point is it now malted.
