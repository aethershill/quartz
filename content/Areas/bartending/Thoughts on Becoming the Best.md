I've recently recommitted to the idea of become the world's best bartender overall. 
I want to be more than proficient in all skillsets. 
Lacking in no area, but maybe not the best in each individual category/skillset. 
Able to jump in to whatever void needs to be filled at the bars I work at.

So far I've settled that to really pursue this goal, I need to do more research and studying. I can't settle for the cruising I've done so far. 
As I've noted in [Bartending Reflection Winter 2023-2024](Areas/blog/posts/Bartending%20Reflection%20Winter%202023-2024.md) while I thought I was good, and maybe I was, I'm not where I could be.

I have a lot of studying to do.
