1792 Full Proof has gone through a distinct filtering process. Instead of the usual [[chill filtration]] it passes through a [[plate and frame filter]]. 

This allows the the [[bourbon]] to maintain a:
- Robust proof for bottling
- and a full, rich, and bold flavor.

Bottled at its 125 barrel [Entry Proof](Areas/bartending/Whiskey/Entry%20Proof.md).

## Tasting Notes
- Strong and full of Flavor
- Deep and Smoky
- Balanced with Sweet Vanilla and notes of caramel
