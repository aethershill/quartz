Whiskey is made of [Grains](Areas/bartending/Grains.md)
The most important ones are:
- Barley (Cereal aroma)
- Corn (Sweetcorn aroma)
- Rye (Spicy and peppery aroma)

Grains are all dry, hard, and full of starch

Before [Fermentation](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Fermentation.md) begins this starch must be turned into sugar

First are [Malted](Areas/bartending/Malting.md) and then crushed and mixed with water to make a sugar liquid. 
### Making Whiskey - 
Start by malting cereal grains.
After this they then go through [[Areas/bartending/Spirits/Fermentation]]. 
Next, they then go through [[Areas/bartending/Spirits/Distillation]] either in a [Pot Still](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Pot%20Stills.md) or a Continuous [Column Still](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Column%20Stills.md).

After [Distillation](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Distillation.md) [whisky](Areas/bartending/Whiskey/Whiskey.md) still isn't ready to be bottled. 

It contains: 
- Sediment from the barrel
- Chemical compounds (like fatty acids)
- Proteins
- and [[Long-chain Esters]]

When the [ABV](Areas/bartending/ABV.md) is lower than about 46% (some distillers believe the threshold is higher) the chemical compounds can create a cloudiness, or haze, when the whisky is chilled.

This haze doesn't pose an hazard to drinkers, but isn't aesthetically pleasing/acceptable. 

This is filtered out through chill-filtration.

Most are then aged in [Oak barrels](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Oak-Aged%20Spirits.md).
