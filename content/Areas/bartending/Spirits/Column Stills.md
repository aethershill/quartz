Overview: 
- [Distillations](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Distillation.md) happen at the same time, one on top of the other. 
- Clever engineering allows vapors to rise up the still, heating the distillation above, and liquid to run down the still.
- The further up the still, the higher the [[ABV]].
- These stills can be run continuously. 

Short column stills with fewer sections can produce [spirits](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Spirit) with a medium or pronounced aroma intensity, similar to a [Pot Still](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Pot%20Stills.md) spirit.
Tall column stills with more sections can produce high-strength spirits that have a light aroma intensity. 

The tallest stills with the greatest number of sections are able to product spirits that have a [neutral aroma intensity with a strength of either 95% or 96% abv](Areas/Bartending/Spirits/Neutral%20Spirit.md).
