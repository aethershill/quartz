Newly made [spirits](Areas/bartending/Spirits/spirit) are colorless and dry as they have no sugar. 
After [Distillation](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Distillation.md), the main aim is to adjust the color, aroma, sweetness, and alcoholic strength as required by the style of spirit being made.

### How
These changes are based on the type of spirit being made.

Three types: 
- [Unaged Spirits](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Unaged%20Spirits.md) 
- [Oak-Aged Spirits](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Oak-Aged%20Spirits.md)
- [Flavored Spirits](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Flavored%20Spirits.md)

The choices available are also dependent on local laws.
For example, Scotch [Whisky](Areas/bartending/Whiskey/Whiskey) must be oak-aged but [Tequila](Areas/bartending/Tequila/Tequila.md) can be either unaged or oak-aged.
