## Preparing for a tasting

Before tasting ensure:
- There are no distracting smells
- There is a good source of natural light
- There is a white surface to help assess appearance of the spirit
- You have a glass with a wide bowl that narrows towards the top (glencairn?)
- You have a clean palate with no lingering flavors (e.g. coffee or toothpaste)
- You are well hydrated

## Recommended Approach
As [Spirits](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Spirit.md) are very strong alcoholic beverages (even though they're already diluted). This makes it hard to assess a spirit even at 40% [ABV](Areas/bartending/ABV.md).
Thus it's recommended to:
- Pour a 1.5cL (or 0.5 US fl. oz.) sample
- Assess appearance and the nose
- Dilute sample with 1.5cL of water
- Reassess the nose
- Assess palate
- Spit
