A neutral spirit must be distilled to a strength of at least 95% [ABV](Areas/bartending/ABV.md) or 96%.
The strength depends on laws of the country where it is being produced.

This strength can only be produced in a [Column Still](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Column%20Stills.md).
Although, some producers use [Pot Stills](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Pot%20Stills.md) during part of the production process.

At this strength a spirit has virtually no flavor which is why it's called 'neutral'
