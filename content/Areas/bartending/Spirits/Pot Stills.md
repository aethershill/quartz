A pot still is made up of a pot with a heat source, a condenser with a coolant, and tubing that links the two.

Most modern pot stills are heated with steam jackets or steam coils. 
This heat source heats up the pot which holds the [liquid](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Fermentation.md) that is going to be [distilled](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Distillation.md).
The vapors rise up the still head and into the condenser. 
The condenser with aid of the coolant cools down the vapor as they pass through coiled metal tubes and condense back into a liquid.

It is a labor intensive batch process.

Pot stills spirits are relatively low [strength](Areas/bartending/ABV.md) with a lot of flavor and character.
This make them great for making spirits such as [Cognac](Areas/bartending/Wine/Cognac.md).
