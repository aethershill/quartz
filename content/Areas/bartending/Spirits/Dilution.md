Most [Spirits](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Spirit.md) are diluted with water and bottled at 40% [ABV](Areas/bartending/ABV.md).

The main reason, is drinkability. Very high levels of [Alcohol](Areas/bartending/Alcohol.md) numb the palate, making it impossible to taste or enjoy.
Dilution is the last thing done before bottling.

This is done by added pure water to the spirit. 
This doesn't add any flavor.
