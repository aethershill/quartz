A [[Spirit]] is an alcoholic beverage that has been [Distilled](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Distillation.md) to increase alcoholic strength. 

However, distillation is not the only process that is common to all spirits. There are 4 key steps involved in spirit production; [Processing Raw Materials](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Processing%20Raw%20Materials.md), [Fermentation](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Fermentation.md), [Distillation](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Distillation.md), and [Post Distillation](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Post%20Distillation.md).
After these steps, most spirits go through [Dilution](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Dilution.md) before being bottled.
