[Pot Still](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Pot%20Stills.md) [Distillation](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Distillation.md) is a batch process. 
The still has to be emptied and cleaned after every distillation. Pot stills can't be operated continuously.
In a pot still, it's not possible to make a spirit with just on distillation. 
Most distillers, who use pot stills, distill twice to create a spirit. (Double pot still distillation).

Fermented alcohol liquid (about 10% [[abv]]) -first distillation-> product of 1st distillation (about 25% abv) -second distillation-> newly made spirit (about 75% abv).

Spirits made in pot stills are relatively low strenght with medium to pronounced aroma instensity and a lot of complexity and character.

Pot stills cannot make really high-strength spirits (spirits with an abv of 90% or more). 
Demand for a still that could operate continuously and make high-strength spirits required a [completely new still design](.
