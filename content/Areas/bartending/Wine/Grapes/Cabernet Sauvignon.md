One of the most recognized [Grapes](Areas/bartending/Wine/Grapes/Grapes.md) in the world. 
Can be found in [wines](Areas/bartending/Wine/Wine.md) from many places, Australia, South America, Napa, etc. 

Full-bodied red, known for black fruit notes(cherry, currant, blackberry).
Usually aged in oak before being bottled for "backbone."

"King of Wine" for popularity and "approachability."

Not uncommon to be blended with a small percentage of other grapes even if not noted on the label. 

Cab from different countries/regions are not the same. 

Great standalone wine, taste great without food.
