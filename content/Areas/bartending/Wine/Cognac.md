From southwest France, Cognac is known as the best [Brandy](Areas/bartending/Wine/Brandy.md).
## Processing
Cognac is specifically made from grapes made in a specific part of south-west France. North of Bordeaux. 
These are what gives Cognac its fruity and floral aromas.
To begin processing, they are pressed to release their juices.

## Fermentation
The juice made is full of sugar and is fermented to make a [Wine](Areas/bartending/Wine/Wine.md).

## Distillation 
The wine is then [Distilled](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Distillation.md).

By law, Cognac has to be double distilled in a [Pot Still](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Pot%20Stills.md).

## Post-Distillation
By law, Cognac must be aged in oak barrels for at least two years before it can be called Cognac.
This [Oak-Aging](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Oak-Aged%20Spirits.md) gives Cognac flavors of vanilla and toast. 

The best Cognacs are aged for much longer than two years. This causes the Cognac to become very concentrated and develop aromas of: 
- Fruit cake
- Leather
- and Wood Polish

Extra complexity is achieved by blending [Spirits](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Spirit.md) of different ages.

Nearly all Cognacs are blends.

Common practice for producers is to use caramel color to slightly sweeten Cognacs before [Diluting](Areas/bartending/Spirits/Dilution.md) and bottling them.

## Types of Cognac
Cognacs are subdivided by their age.
