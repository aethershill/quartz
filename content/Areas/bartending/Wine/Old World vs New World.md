[[Old World]] wines are lighter-bodied, lower in alcohol, and brighter acidity.
They show more earth-driven flavors.

[[New World]] wines are fuller-bodied, higher in alcohol, lower acidity.
They are more ripe on the palate. 

Some things to note: the line between the two differentiators is fading. 

Climate change is pushing the [[Alcohol]] percentage in old world wines up and causing the grapes to be more ripe.
Changes in the wine industry is causing new world [[Vignerons]] to find higher elevation sites to grow grapes which lead to higher acidity and lower their [[ABV]].
