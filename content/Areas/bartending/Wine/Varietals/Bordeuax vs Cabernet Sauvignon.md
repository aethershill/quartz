A [[Bordeaux]] can be a [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] but a Cab Sauv is not often a Bordeaux. 

The two common mistakes made when purchasing or ordering [[wine]] is not understanding the difference between the two wines.

1. Cabernet Sauvignon is a grape. 
2. Bordeaux is a region in France known for Cabernet production.
