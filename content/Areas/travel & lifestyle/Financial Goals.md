Emergency Fund - $6,000 
Guesstimate for 3 month emergency fund
To be saved in HYSA, (Apple is 4.15% APY) consider finding better account. If better account is found, keep $2000 in Apple HYSA for 1 month EF, 5 month EF in higher interest rate account.

$1000 for plane ticket so someone can get my Koseki for me.

Van Life Build - $85,000 for van.
(?) est. cost for conversion
