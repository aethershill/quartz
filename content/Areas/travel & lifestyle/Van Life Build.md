Personal thoughts:
Originally thought I might try to find a used van for a slight discount, but it looks like the cost isn't that much cheaper. 
Hard considering buying brand new.

Diesel vehicles tend to have longer lifespan than gas. 

4x4 

Likely going to get Ford Transit w/ High Roof, Extended Base.

Mainly due to being able to go virtually anywhere to get work done. This will be ideal since I'll be in remote places a lot (CO and AK).

As of 11/3/23 Buying brand new with all the features I think I want van will cost $69,920 pre-tax before conversion.


### Bed
Electric motor lift bed
Two options for control, stop at preferred height to allow for bunk bed set up.

Voice activation would be good.
Think arduino/raspberry pie hooked up. + 2/3 buttons with easy heights.

Button Layout -
