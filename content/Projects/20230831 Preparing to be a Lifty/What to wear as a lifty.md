# What to wear
## Clothing Material
Highly suggested to get wool for any clothing that touches skin. 
Smartwool 250 is great for upper body.

## Gloves
Most liftys agree that Kinco are the most popular/best suited for the job.
The ideal is not to spend too much on gloves as they get lost frequently, they also get worn down/beaten up so it's best not to use snowboard/ski gear for work. 

#### Sno-Seal vs Mink Oil  

## Underwear
Good thermal underwear
Consider legless tights since they're great for not having to jam into boots or overlap tall socks
Thick wool socks 

## Footwear
Steel Toe Muck Boots(?)
- Muck Arctics
- Arctic Sport ST
- Sorrel Boots - Decent, durable, but not good at below 0, snow will stick to furry part(?), some say they have a tendency to crack
- Hardshell mountaineering boots (if running cold in the feet)
- Military surplus boots (mickey mouse style? or goretex)

## Accessories/Misc. Items
Thermos for hot coffee/tea.
Lunch Cooler - to keep food from freezing
1.5 Nalgene (basically just get a big water bottle) consider a vacuum double walled bottle so water doesn't freeze
Good belt if I have to wear a radio

## Sunglasses
Most people suggest getting a good pair of affordable(replaceable) sunglasses as the job will eat through them. 
Through a combination of damage/just generally getting lost it's best not to wear a pair of really expensive sunglasses.

Another side of the argument is to forego sunglasses in general and use comfortable snowboard/ski goggles in lieu of sunglasses.


### Example fits 
Someone suggested fleece mid layer with puffer jacket on cold days 
3-4 pairs of base layers
Synthetic sweater or wind breaker layer would be nice to add on top of work jacket

Carry 2 pairs of Warm Socks, Gloves, Face Masks/Baclava's
Good warm blanket, water supply(bottle), shelf stable food? in case I get stuck somewhere
