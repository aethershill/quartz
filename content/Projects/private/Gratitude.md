I am so extremely grateful for the friends and family I've made. 

I lost my job two days ago. More specifically, I was fired. 
It was my own fault.
I thought I couldn't really fight it, I accepted it as the consequence of my actions. 

I've been angry all summer. I've hated how my workplace has been running. I've tried not to be this way, focusing on how this was a step necessary to get to where I want to go. Reminding myself not to get stuck on the small things, on that specific moment. Reminding myself that in a month I'll be surfing. I'll be learning how to snowboard in two.

I failed.

When I looked in the mirror, I could only blame myself. I am the problem.

And I have to live with that, and work harder on getting better. To ensure I never put myself into this situation again. I hope I'm never in this position again.

The silver lining, I saw the love and support of my friends.

Honestly I'd been feeling isolated, alone, wondered whether I had anyone. Deep down somewhere I knew that wasn't the case. But I let that get in the way.

I cannot put into words. The emotions I feel, I feel like tears are constantly about to well up in my eyes.
The show of love from everyone. I had so many friends checking in with me. So many offering suggestions, reaching out to people trying to find jobs for me. Mark reached out to a bunch of people and gave me a list, let me know a brewhouse NEEDED bartenders and was waiting for my application. Justina fought for me in HR. Put together a meeting for me where I could explain, apologize, ask for a second chance. Tom called her and was ready to fight for me. 
Kim and Wesley genuinely gave me a chance to explain and speak. The anger and empathy my friends show, Alex lavesque (I really don't want to forget his support), Mel, Mato. 
So many people checking in, Cass, Danager, Eva, Donnie, Marie, Jason, Levi, Trickey, Mike, Birdy. 
Nate offered me to crash at his place, mel offered me to crash on her floor for a bit. So many people offered to give me rides or help if I needed to get somewher.
The list goes on and on and on and on.

I have such good friends that are so good to me. 
And when I felt most hopeless.
They were there.
