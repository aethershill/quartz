# My Experience - 
Being a Lifty has been *the* chillest job I've ever worked. 
Winter 23-24 was my first year ever at a ski resort (or even ski hill) so going in I had no idea what to really expect. 
Drawing on other people's experiences online helped prepare me somewhat but there were a lot of minor details that I experienced and figured out on my own.

# Previous experience
A common question people have is: Do I need experience?

They mean this in two ways. 
Do I need previous experience working as a lift operator?
Do I need skiing/snowboarding experience?

Respectively, no and mostly no. 

Being a lifty is such an easy job I find it hard to imagine someone not qualifying for the role. 
If you don't mind being in the public eye (interacting with guests), working outside in the snow, and following the few instructions you receive from managers and supervisors you'll be just fine.

As for ski/snowboard experience. I say mostly because there *are* lifts that you do need to know how to ride to get to. The bright side is that at most, if not all mountains (I can only personally attest to Steamboat), there are lifts you can work where riding is minimal or entirely unnecessary.
