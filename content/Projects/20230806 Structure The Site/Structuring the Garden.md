Some of my first thoughts on how I want this to look:

I really like the Map of Content from https://www.ssp.sh/brain// so figuring out how to do something similar would be ideal. 

I also want to include a blog hyperlink in the header, make it easier to access. 

In order to do these two things, I need to figure out how to properly customize/format inside of [[Areas/blog/posts/Humble Beginnings|Humble Beginnings]]/[[Areas/blog/Quartz|Quartz]]. I believe this requires me to learn more about [[Resource/wiki/web design/Hugo|Hugo]]

Currently reading: https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/ on [[Resource/wiki/web design/Taxonomies|Taxonomies]]. 

Appears that taxonomies would be useful for the wiki, but not for easier access to blog/posts.
