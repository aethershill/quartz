I've always been enamored by the idea of having my own personal website. 
Never quite knowing what to do with one, I'd always wasted time and procrastinated the idea. 

That is, until recently when I stumbled upon the idea of a [[Resource/wiki/web design/Digital Garden|Digital Garden]].
Closely related is a rabbit whole of productivity/systems like [[Resource/wiki/productivity/PARA|PARA]] and [[Resource/wiki/pkm/Second Brain|Second Brain]] that has opened up a whole new idea of what my site and productivity systems could look like. 

As such, here lies the beginning of my personal wiki. The place where all of the knowledge and experience I have and will continue to accumulate will come together.
