Closely related is a rabbit whole of productivity/systems like [[Resource/wiki/productivity/PARA|PARA]] and [[Resource/wiki/pkm/Second Brain|Second Brain]] that has opened up a whole new idea of what my site and productivity systems could look like. 

As such, here lies the beginning of my personal wiki. The place where all of the knowledge and experience I have and will continue to accumulate.
