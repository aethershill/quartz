Notes:
CS/Min quite low. 
8 CS per minute should be the goal at this elo. 
Average value of a minion is 21.

By missing 2.2 cs every minute, losing 46.2 gold ever minute. By 10 minutes that's 462 gold. 20 minutes 924 gold.
That's a full tier 2 item behind + exp missed.

Built BotRK second item.
While this seemed like a decent idea, by the time it was finished, laning and dueling phase was over and teams were grouping more. 
Tiamat/Hydra second would have been best as it would have allowed split pushing + more csing.

Feels like there's some delay/random lag. Need to play with that in mind.

Using q + w poke was great. 
Need to work on using w then q for escape.
