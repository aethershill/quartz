A Digital Garden is an online place that is one part notebook one part blog where the author(s) share [Seeds](Resource/wiki/web%20design/Seed.md) of thoughts/ideas that are then grown.

Unlike blogs where after being posted the content is static and slowly growing outdated. Digital Gardens are maintained and updated.
