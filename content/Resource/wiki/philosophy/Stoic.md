A stoic is motivated not by the rewards of being virtuous, but by actually being a virtuous/excellent person. 

> so pleasure is not the reward or the cause of virtue, but comes in addition to it; nor do we choose virtue because she gives us pleasure, but she gives us pleasure also if we choose her. *Of a Happy Life Book 9 (Stewartâ€™s Translation)*
