Also known as "three act structure." Is a model that divides the story into 3 parts (or acts). 

The Setup ([[First Act]]), The Confrontation ([[Second Act]]), and the Resolution.

Popularized by Syd Field
Falsely attributed to Aristotle who argued for a two-act structure.

The plot usually asks the [[Dynamic Question]] which must be answered in the climax of the story.
