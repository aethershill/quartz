`"Editing is structure, color, dynamis, manipulation of time, all of these other things, etc., etc." In the Blink of an Eye - 2nd Edition (Murch, 2001)`

The main goal of an editor is to think of the perspective of the viewer. 

It is important to disconnect personal feelings attached to different takes as the viewer will not have that context.

An editor's job is to: 
	1. Encourage courses of action.
	2. Assemble/Interpret what the author/director is saying
	3. Discuss whether to include material or whether new material should be added.

2. Assemble/Interpret what the author/director is saying
Question or otherwise draw assumptions in order to find the true idea/emotion behind scenes/imagery. In order to interpret/display it as intended.
