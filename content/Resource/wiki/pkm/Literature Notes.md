Literature notes are the comments we make on texts we've decided to highlight or mark down.
## Should Do:
- Summarize the content
- Include key take aways
- Add Comments that help us remember thoughts we had when reading/writing down the text.
- Include: Book title, Author, Chapter, and Page Number
