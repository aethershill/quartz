A combination of [[Resource/wiki/pkm/Personal Information Management|Personal Information Management]](PIM) and [[Resource/wiki/pkm/Knowledge Management|Knowledge Management]](KM).

Things to note: 

- Everything should be curated. Not everything needs to be noted down or stored in the PKM system.
- Just as the information needs to be curated, the sources need to be as well. 

The "best" PKMs borrow from the idea of [[Zettelkasten]]. 
The reason for this is that the appeal/strong point of the Zettelkasten is in the sheer volume of [Notes](Resource/wiki/pkm/Notes.md) as well as how they interact/bump into each other. It's a system that shows you how one idea is subtly related to another idea which could then lead to a new idea.
