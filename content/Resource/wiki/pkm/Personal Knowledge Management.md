title: "Personal Knowledge Management"

A combination of [[Resource/wiki/pkm/Personal Information Management|Personal Information Management]]PIM) and [[Resource/wiki/pkm/Knowledge Management|Knowledge Management]](KM).

Things to note: 

Everything should be curated. Not everything needs to be noted down or stored in the PKM system.
Just as the information needs to be curated, the sources need to be as well. 

The "best" PKMs borrow from the idea of Zettlekasten. 
The reason for this is that the appeal/strong point of the zettlekasten is in the sheer volume of notes as well as how they interact/bump into each other. It's a system that shows you how one idea is subtly related to another idea which could then lead to a new idea.
