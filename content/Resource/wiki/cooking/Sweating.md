# Why
Sweating softens and releases flavors using moisture and low temperature.
# How 
Covering the pan and heating over low temperature with frequent stirring.

The fat holds "non-volatile flavors" as they're released. The lid traps the steam, which condenses and drips (onto the onions).

# Result
Tender, translucent pieces. With no browning.

# Notes
In [[Italy]] this technique is known as soffritto. Which means sub-frying or under-frying.
