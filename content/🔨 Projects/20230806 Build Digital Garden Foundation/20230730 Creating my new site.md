title: "{{Creating My Own Site}}"

I've always wanted to have a personal website. Never really knew what its purpose would be but I've always wanted to have one. 

Finally stumbled upon an idea called a [[ðŸ”¨ Projects/20230806 Build Digital Garden Foundation/20230730 Digital Garden]]
Trying to figure out what exactly the idea/philosophy behind a digital garden is sort of tough, but my understanding of it as an highly interconnected repository of knowledge. 
Some of the graphs I'm seeing really illustrates the links between different ideas. It's wild. 

In order to start, I'm doing more and more research. 

I've decided on using [[ðŸ”¨ Projects/20230806 Build Digital Garden Foundation/20230730 Obsidian]] as my editor as I think it has the most capability for creating the backlinks needed? It looks clean and I from my understanding it works well with [[ðŸ”¨ Projects/20230806 Build Digital Garden Foundation/20230730 Quartz]].

The primary inspiration for my garden is: https://www.ssp.sh/brain// 
I feel like the structure of the site can act as a good foundation/example for what mine could be.
