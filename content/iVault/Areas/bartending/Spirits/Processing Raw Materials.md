The aim of processing a raw material is to create a sugary liquid for [[Fermentation]].

Raw materials must of plant origin. Any plant can be used but only a small number are.

The two main points on processing raw materials: 
- The sugar comes from the raw material. Some materials have sugar that is easy to extract while others don't contain sugar and must be processed to create sugar.
- Each raw material gives a [[Spirit]] a unique set of aromas.
