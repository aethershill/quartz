Often, there is little point in correcting the spelling as both are right.

The Scots spell it [whisky](Whiskey)
This influenced Scottish settlers in Canada and Distilleries making spirits that were influenced by Scottish styles.

The Irish spell it whiskey
Which was "standardized," due to its influence by Irish American immigrants.
